1.  Developing regulatory guidelines

NEPAD has drafted guidelines that member states can look at.  They want this to be seen as a member state process, but could seek input from us.  
2. Developing training materials and training sessions

WMU/FNIH can provide content.  They do not have other plans for other trainings.

Facilitating reviews and inspections.  They do not yet know what assistance they might require from us.<br>

3.  Study tours <br>
4.  Policy and advocacy<br>
5.  Advising scientists on the regulatory landscape

Advising other projects—FNIH can serve as liaison with projects and NEPAD.  African team members of projects can contact NEPAD directly.  FNIH can provide “outside intelligence”. NEPAD can deal with issues that arise from Africans.
