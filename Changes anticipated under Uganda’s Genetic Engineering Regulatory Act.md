Brinda:

Changes anticipated under Uganda’s new Genetic Engineering Regulatory act-
Act applies to research (lab, contained research, confined research, full safety assessments), import, export, transit, and general use of GMOs and excludes pharmaceuticals
Scope of the act- GE plants, animals, microbials (including insects).
A new ministry responsible for genetic engineering designated by the President
Council for Genetic Engineering as independent competent authority will be established and headed by a CEO.
Key arms of the council to be established
                NBC as a technical body of the council
                Office of the registrat will handle administrative work of GM applications
UNCST will have promotional roles and capacity building for public education and communication
Ministry to Science and Technology will also play promotional roles and may have certain regulatory roles such as inspectional roles.
 
All reviews will be conducted at the NBC level. Environmental safety, food safety and socio economic considerations are primary areas of expertise that will be represented on the new committee of 16 members. All relevant government agencies shall have input into applications on case by case basis.
Time Frames as stated in the law-
Lab expts                             approved by IBCs             21 working days
Contained testing             approved by IBC               28 working days
Confined field test           competent authority      90 working days
General release                competent authority      270 working days
Import export transit      competent authority      28 working days
Most of the key provisions are taken directly from the Cartagena Protocol.
Hoping that liability and redress currently on the PI and patent holder but hopeful that this will be explained in the implementing regulations that will follow and will soften the effect of the law as it currently stands.
 
Regulations anticipated-
Procedures for research
Procedures for general release of GMOS in the environment
Handling, transport, ID and packaging of GMOs
Safety levels and standards for safety of GMOs
Procedures for bio-ethical considerations in biotech research
 
Uganda has conducted several CFTs on GM crops-
Potato resistance to late blight
Cotton- boll worm, herbicide, water stress
Cassava- several traits
Banana- several traits
Current NBC will continue to oversee ongoing CFTs on crops. There will be an orderly transition to the new system in time.
 
 
Highlights from Dr Mugoya’s talk today. These changes may take 2-3 years to take effect assuming the president signs the law in its current form.
