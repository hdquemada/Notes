# Horizontal Gene Transfer Literature Review for Target Malaria

## Purpose

Target Malaria has asked GeneConvene to commission a literature review that would provide information on the steps in the pathway to harm from horizontal gene transfer (HGT) that are described in Connolly et al. (2021). From the e-mail sent to GeneConvene from Geoff Turner:

> The aim of this literature review would be to discuss the various steps that need to occur for the CRISPR/Cas9 construct to enter the germline of another eukaryote organism, to be functional and look for evidence of functional gene sequences of the size of the dsx transgene being transferred from Anopheles to other eukaryotes during evolution (Kyrou et al., 2018).

## Proposed approach

The pathways to harm in Connolly et al. (2021) where HGT plays a role are number 4 and number 5. In the analysis plan for pathway 5, there are two literature assessments mentioned (numbered items 1 and 2 below). I have broken down item 1 of the an into more detail, based on the steps of the plausible pathway described, to identify more specific areas that could be the subject of the literature review.

1.  Literature assessment to determine the likelihood and expected timescale required for a stretch of DNA of circa 7 kb to be transferred from transgenic mosquitoes to valued species by nonsexual means
    
    a.  Literature assessment of the frequency of a virus or bacteria acquiring (incorporation into its genome; been transformed with) a 7 kb piece of DNA.
    
    b.  Frequency of valued species exposed to viruses or bacteria. Since it will be difficult to identify valued species, and the language of this step in the pathway says “exposure”, I don’t think we can answer this from the literature, but we can assume that this frequency = 1.
    
    c.  Frequency of infection of a valued species by a virus or bacterium that has acquired the piece of DNA in 1. For the same reasons as 1b., assume frequency = 1.
    
    d.  Literature assessment of the frequency that a virus or bacterium infecting a host transfers without integration a piece of DNA of 7 kb to the germ line of its host.
    
    e.  Literature assessment of the frequency that the 7 kb piece of DNA is integrated into the germ line of its host. Parts d. and e. will probably have to be combined. The literature review would then focus on the size of DNA sequences that have been known to be transferred and the frequency that these horizontal gene transfer frequencies have occurred over evolutionary time.

2.  Literature assessment of functionality of dsx transgene in the germline of other Diptera or valued non-Dipteran insects (such as pollinators)

## Proposed next steps

To proceed further on this project, I propose verifying with Target Malaria that the areas to cover in the previous section aligns with their view of what they need from us. We would then identify one or two individuals who could conduct the literature review. I do not think that the person who does this review would necessarily have to be an expert in the field. Practical experience in risk assessment, especially in the approach used by Connolly et al., would be more relevant, although a co-author who is expert in the field would be valuable in identifying the appropriate sources of literature.
