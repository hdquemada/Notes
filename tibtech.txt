Paragraph, lines 106-121: discuss how this will affect decisions regarding genome editing that have already been established by some countries/regions.

Paragraph, lines 136-144: Given the projected increase in applications that are aimed at engineering organisms that are not agricultural but more wild or unmanaged (such as insects--e.g. diamondback moth, mosquitoes; or fish that would not necessarily be confined to defined areas of release like agricultural fields), would it be advisable to recommend revisions in Section III that would address these applications as well? This new area of applications would also challenge the concept of familiarity (lines 73-78). Would it be useful for the OECD Recommendation to be updated to account for this challenge?
