  Notes from GIC call 2019-04-23

  2.  Relevant associated meetings

     *   ISBR/GIC Poster

     *   Anglophone Africa workshop on risk assessment

Organized by SA DEAT. Supported by CLI.  Corteva organized visit to their facilities. SA
will be taking chair of AMSEN (environment) they want to run the African group for
post-2020 framework. ACB was given a position with the parties, which was objected to by
GIC.  CPB guidance document was not used much (just referred to).  Five full days.  Junior
staff mostly attended.  Only a few countries had decision-makers or focal points.

     *   EFSA Workshop on Problem formulation for the
environmental risk assessment of gene drive modified insects |
Brussels, 15 May 2019. A briefing note to participants was
published (https://events.efsa.europa.eu/uploads/originals/GMO2019
/briefing_notes_GMO%20workshop.pdf)

  3.  Review of submissions on gene drives and LM fish (summary
below) – Tab B

     *   Most submissions are from Parties who indicate they have
little to no experience in ERA of either product (this is in
alignment with the GIC submission on gene drives)

     *   Most Parties focus on gene drives and ignore or give
cursory attention to LM fish

     *   Overall, there is a focus on gene drives in terms of
unique challenges to ERA (targeting a wild population; likelihood
of spread; difficulty to contain in R&D; etc.), even for those
submissions that do not appear to be "anti" gene drives;

     *   Only a handful of countries (EU/MSs, US, Australia)
provided any kind of regulations or existing guidance

     *   Several submissions (EU, Mexico) specifically support
work of the AHTEG on these two products

     *   For the last question on "needs", most of the responses
that address this come from the perspective of capacity building
needs from developing countries

     *   The GIC's submission is, as usual, the most direct and
relevant in terms of answering the actual questions

GIC will reach out to Target Malaria during the EFSA meeting to see if there is any
support that they might be able to offer.

There is a sensitivity toward the narrative about Target Malaria being a smokescreen for
agriculture.

Gene drives will likely be the are of focus in the CBD and CPB, even with countries that
are aligned on other topics with the GIC.

  4.  Review of GIC Risk Assessment Workgroup operating
plan/upcoming calendar – Tab C

     *   Next steps for workgroup actions

Risk Assessment AHTEG nominations are still open? Should increase the possibility of
balance in the group.

No schedule yet for online forum (probably later in 2019).  AHTEG will probably be early
2020.
