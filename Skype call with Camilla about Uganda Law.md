-  **Strict liability still there**
>   A person who owns a patent in a GEM is strictly liable for any harm, injury
>   or loss caused directly or indirectly by such a GEM to the community
>   livelihood, indigenous knowledge systems or technologies, environment,
>   biodiversity, ecosystem, species of flora and fauna, human or animal health.
>   (2) In this section, “a patent”, means the exclusive right granted by a
>   government to any person in respect of a GEM, to manufacture, use, or sell
>   the GEM.

-   **Not apply only to crops—to all GE; Drugs regulated by another authority.**

-   **Stages of research**

    -   Lab experiments

    -   Contained testing (greenhouse)

    -   Confined testing

    -   Contained tests

    -   General release

-   **Structure**

    -   Competent authority in the Ministry responsible for genetic engineering

    -   Inter-ministerial Policy Committee

    -   National Genetic Engineering Committee—review and make recommendations on applications received by competent authority

    -   IBC’s—need a certificate of approval by Competent Authority

-   **Gene Bank requirement**
>   The Competent Authority shall, before the approval of any stage of research,
>   require the applicant to obtain written confirmation from the relevant
>   institution on whether the indigenous animal or plant variety is preserved
>   in an indigenous gene bank.

-   **Every stage shall require genetic engineering quality certificate.**

-   **Public comment**

    -   All lab experiments have to be published in paper for public comment, but not the same for contained use

    -   General release—14 days, publish decision in paper and websites of all ministries; 45 days for all relevant persons to make presentations. No mechanism for handling. The entire application goes into the public domain.

-   **Import—requires report that the product is necessary for use in Uganda, and no non-GM alternative**

-   **Evidence of availability of mitigation funds.**

-   **Failure to implement emergency measures for unintentional release is an offense.**


-   **Relevance to sterile males?**

>   …introduces a terminator seed, or a gene that is genetically engineered to
>   make any offspring of a crop sterile, or unable to reproduce or uses genetic
>   use restriction technology; commits an offence and shall on conviction be
>   liable to a fine not exceeding two thousand currency points or imprisonment
>   not exceeding twenty years or both…
