 •	FNIH/WMU et al. being invited by African regulators, scientist, experts, to participate in their workshops that they organize (this would be a follow-on to the prior bullet sort of the whole program coming full circle to where we would not be there to run things but to participate as equals).
 •	Ability to review regulatory documents/dossiers, undertake a risk assessment of their own
