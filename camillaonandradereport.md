Huge apologies but I have only got around to reading this now. I expect that I am way too late to have any meaningful input but would like you to know that I  have several issues with the piece - so many that I gave up writing comments...

A) it is not well referenced - there should be many more references to the laws in the countries as well as the sections of the protocol being referenced.  There is no indication really about the sources of the information - links to online sources would be very helpful especially about the status of the implementation

B) to my reading it is quite subjective and not as factual as I would expect - more an opinion piece rather than a critical evaluation of the implementation of the laws in Africa/ which country has which law etc.  Even a link to the databases held at the CPB is missing ( I know they are out of date frequently regarding African countries ).

C) key texts are missing such as the AU report on technology innovation and using gene drive for malaria control : https://www.nepad.org/publication/gene-drives-malaria-control-and-elimination-africa <https://www.nepad.org/publication/gene-drives-malaria-control-and-elimination-africa>

D) there is a high level of focus on the African model law on biosafety - which I understood had not found favour due to the strict interpretation of the precautionary principle - but if it is going to be quoted extensively then it should be at least be referenced in its final iteration.

E) there is no evaluation of what it could mean for a mobile mosquito released in one country and crossing the border into the next - something that I would be really interested in


…. and so on

What is the current status of the document and how will it be used ?  I certainly would not find it useful in its current format

Thanks
