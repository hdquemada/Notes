## Day  02/10/19
### Group Synthesis session
#### Group 3
* Approach
	* concentrated on key steps in the fault tree.
	* a linear flow diagram would have been more helpful than fault trees
	* relied a lot on reviews
* First endpoint was the most difficult 
* Water quality one was not difficult, they just didn’t accept that any paths led to harm.
* HGT—felt that likelihoods were too high
* Niche replacement was seen as a gap
* Comparative harm relative to mosquito control
#### Group 2
* Animal health—struggled with it
* Changed the pathways and harm
* Struggled with water quality
* Horizontal gene transfer—struggled with what the harm
#### Group 1
* Went through all the fault trees in their entirety, rather that focus on key steps
* Places where they were not happy with the “protection goal”—where was the harm?
* Viruses—didn’t know how to deal with it because not virus expertise.
* Niche replacement noted as not being dealt with.
* Systematic literature review methodology
	* Prizma
	* Cochran reviews
	* Good quality non-peer reviewed data
#### Group 4
* Focus on critical steps
* Datasets that would be helpful across fault trees
* Sequence datasets might help answer questions of HGT—would there be evidence for active genes.
* Fault trees for sterile males—needed to take account gene drive.
* Should benefits be included in the risk assessment and pathways?—The group carried out the risk assessment and even if they identified suppressed populations as a harm, the decision should include benefits.
* Discussion of biology of gambiae—how little is known about the interaction of the species in the environment.  Because there is now a concern about the role of mosquitoes in the environment.
* Niche replacement was also discussed.
* Water quality pathways were not lent much credence.  But they made an effort to take them seriously so that they could defend being dismissive.
* Criticism of the fault tree approach:  harms or endpoints were not really harms but change.
* Some of the group felt that biodiversity and human health were not as separately defined as expected.

## Day 3 02/12/19
### Human Health
#### Group 1
* Had problems with the fault tree structures, especially the lack of relating to harm.
* FT2, Novel blood-borne pathogens:  
	* Biological transmission: crucial step was pathogen replicates in mosquito.  Can use quantitative PCR
	* Mechanical transmission: proboscis characterization.
* Literature review:  need to use a systematic process for scanning the literature.

#### Group 2
* Thought process
	* went through the fault trees to discuss whether they were useful for risk assessment
	* constructed pathways to harm, because they indicated change but didn’t indicated what harm were we to assess.  This was also a better tool for communication.
* Impossible to test for everything in a transgenic organism
* Increased vectorial capacity—could be used for other known pathogens as well.
* Novel blood-borne pathogen:  was more difficult, more useful to focus on known pathogens.

#### Group 3
* Approach identify the weakest link
* Vectorial capacity
	* Does the pathogen travel to the salivary gland
* FT2
	* Biological transmission travel to the salivary gland
		* viruses that were transmitted by other mosquitoes
		* viruses that were not
	* Mechanical transmission
		* proboscis
* Data validation--go through literature review first , then do experiments

#### Group 4
* Salivary gland was a key organ to study
* Focused on known pathogens rather than novel pathogens. [so, endpoint 1]
	* Key step that might be investigated:  extrinsic incubation period.
	* Some information that needs to be gathered pre-release
* Problems with fault trees and sensitivity stars--did not agree with using them to focus on certain steps.

### Animal Health

#### Group 2
* Same as for Human Health

#### Group 3
* Same as for Human Health
* What pathogens are transmitted in animals?

#### Group 3
* Same as for Human Health
* What pathogens are transmitted in animals?

#### Group 1
* Plausible pathway:  If human Plasmodium is present in animals—what happens if that is removed?  Will lack of an immune response to Plasmodium make them susceptible to other pathogens?

### Biodiversity

#### Group 2
* Fault tree 3: no plausible mechanism for mosquito breeding with a vertebrate
* Wrote their own fault tree—testable hypotheses
* Information on GM constructs
* Mating barriers w/other spp.: do they produce fertile offspring?
* Apparent competition (reduction in prey results in the reduction of one predator, allows another common predator to increase)—studies on food web would address

#### Group 3
* FT3: 
	* Likelihood of survival of DNA—can look at literature reviews
	* Risk management—engineer transformation vectors to be not susceptible to transposase
	* Address HGT by logical arguments, literature review
	
#### Group 1
* Most likely spread to non-target eukaryote would be through mating.  Do a genetic analysis to determine evidence of gene 
* Other non-targets:  HGT happens but small pieces of DNA that are transferred.  Literature review to determine the likelihood of large construct to be acquired.
* Transposon-mediated HGT not relevant for doublesex.
* Considered remote likelihood of occurrence
* Lack of harm.

#### Group 4
* FT4—HGT to non-target eukaryotes:  gene drives don’t work in prokaryotes so this would be like other pieces of DNA
* Bioinformatics: to see if evidence of these events in long timeframes.
* Size of DNA transfer
* Lack of harm from HGT
* Need a good understanding of An. g. biology
* Mosquito role in pollination: observation studies

### Water Quality
#### Group 4

#### Group 1
* Protein stability 
* Toxin database check
* Impact of differential predation on the spread of the drive

#### Group 3
* Toxicity could be tested
* History of larvicidal applications— no Anopheline found replacing An. g. in small bodies of water.

#### Group 2
* An. g. don’t live in drinking water.
* Toxicity of the protein
* Didn’t consider ephemeral water bodies because the aren’t the source of drinking water
