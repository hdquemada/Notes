If you're at a hotel that has slow wifi that uses a just a password to gain access, try gaining access to the administrator's console and put yourself in the fast lane using the following steps:
Type 192.168.1.1 into your web browser
A pop up window should come up saying something along the lines of "The server http://192.168.1.1 requires a username and password. The server says: router make and model"
Most people do not change the default username/password so try admin for both username and password.
If that does not work try googling "make/model default password" to find the default
Now that you've gained access try finding the "client list", this will likely be under "DHCP", and find your computer's ip address. Write these down.
The last step is to go to IP QoS, this will likely be in the sidebar. You will see a screen similar to this . Fill in your ip address and give yourself at least 10000 kbps (10 mbps).
Enjoy your lightning fast internet.
Note: You may have to repeat this process whenever you restart your computer or you become disconnected from the network.
