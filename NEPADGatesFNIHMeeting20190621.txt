## Present:  Stephanie, Hudu, Aggrey, Jeremy, Willy, Brinda, Susan, Karen T., Raj; Helen Jamet on phone

## Addis meeting:

- Fil Randazzo working on a common gene drive vocabulary
- Data sharing needs [HDQ to look into USAID data sharing requirements and what they're doing in that area.]
- Gene drive registry
- Ethics: prior informed consent relative to discussions in CBD.  Raj: Look at Helsinki Declaration. Jeremy: NEPAD
  meeting next week with ___ to discuss prior informed consent measures so far in Burkina Faso. This topic needs to be
  managed carefully because it's early on. Aggrey: NEPAD has technical working groups working on other regulatory
  issues--suggests including this topic as a "by the way" item during the technical working group meetings. Jeremy:
  ethical considerations have been considered in the technical working group, but there is a struggle in these groups to
  deal with this issue at this time; they need to take positions that balance the needs of Africa.

  - Containment guidelines
  - ... 
  - ... 
### Capacity Strengthening

## Plans

### FNIH: See FNIH presentation

#### Regulatory mapping project discussion
- Concern: Currency of information

- Raj: Take what is already there and publicly available, and produce baseline information as a first step.  Link up to
  available NEPAD information as reference.

### NEPAD

#### Goals
- Enhance understanding of gene drives
- Improve social acceptance
- Strengthen capacity of regulators for all phases of gene drive product development
- Operationalize regional and continental regulatory platforms for IVM, using malaria and gene drive as pathfinders
- Create enabling policy and regulatory platform for gene drive mosquitoes to be tested.

#### Calestous Juma Dialogue on Innovation and Emerging Technologies
- Capacity strengthening for decisionmakers and regulators in Africa
- Supporting African collaborators of product developers
- Awards for excellence in promoting emerging technology

### Collaboration for 2019
- Other workshops:  Jeremy will give further consideration and will get back to us
	- need-driven topics for West Africa
	- more general for other regions to raise awareness and gain political support
- Next steps
	- Hector to return revised Maputo agenda to Jeremy.  NEPAD will determine whether this can also be delivered to
	  other regions
	- Hector to provide Aggrey with a list of current consultants and expertise. NEPAD will look at the list to see how
	  the expertise can support their plans for the rest of the year.
- CBD preparations: these are well advanced already, but Hector will be the point of contact for FNIH/WMU.  Main contact
  at NEPAD-ABNE will be Sam Timpo.
- Future workshops (2019 and beyond)
	- Containment guidance for gene drive mosquitoes
	- At least one workshop for monitoring guidance
	- Field trial design
- List of recurring questions: see list.  Develop positions on these questions.
- MOU: postpone until AUDA reorganization complete, and collaboration between FNIH and NEPAD is ongoing
- Next F2F: Washington DC in the Fall and Africa Q1 next year.
