# Title

## Introduction

- [check into representative from Senegal here at the meeting]

- In this meeting, we will be addressing Phase 1 activities of the WHO development pathway.  What
  data are required (technical and regulatory) to justify movement beyond Phase 1.

## Efficacy parameters:  what to measure? (efficacy predictors for suppression vs. replacement).

- construct-specific parameters

- construct-induced phenotypes on the individual level

- life history and other parameters of the strain

- effector resistance

- second site modifiers

- maternal nuclease deposition

- other

- effects on the parasite

## How to measure?

- influence of genetic background

	- mosquito:  how equivalent must the candidate be to wild type at the field site?  What level of
	  introgression is enough?
	
	- parasite: how should we take into account circulating strains at the field site?

- impact of dynamic conditions:  temperature, density, release ratio, etc.

- how long to measure?

## Breakout group 1:  Translating to experimental laboratory/insectary protocols-design of efficacy
studies.

### Replacement:

- Efficacy of the effector against Plasmodium falciparum
	
	- sporozoite blocking:  high intensity infection; low intensity infection (reflects field)
		
		- zero sporozoites in salivary glands under low intensity infection
		
		- replicated tests
		
		- test in more than one lab (ring tests). Mechanisms for exchange of test materials and
		  standardized protocols needed.
		
		- controls: parental strain
		
		- infect homozygous driving strain

Then...

- Fitness: 	
	
	- 50% cage test: does it persist or increase? 
		
		- driving strain vs. non-driving allele strain
		
		- time?
		
		- cage size?
	
	- fitness parameters as described in the literature (life table measurements).


### Suppression:

- Homing rate:  
	
	- single generation cross (heterzygote transgenic male X homozygous wt female).
	
	- measure biased inheritance in F1
	
	- measure viable genotypes in F1

- Test performance in small cage compared with modeling, based on parameters measured on the specific
  strain

### Genetic source of the material:  what genotype do you transform?

Recommend that efficacy testing should be replicated in genotype of local release. 

### Data needs from the field

- Mosquito population structure and size
	
	- Anton Cornel: malaria control programs have fixed population surveillance sites, which can be useful datan
	  for monitoring population fluctuations.
	
	- Fredros and Jonathan:  their programs don't do that

- Potential dispersal (active, passive)

- Interactions with other malaria control methods, including insecticide-based methods

- Insecticide resistance
	
	- ensure that the GM mosquitoes are not more resistant than wild populations
	
	- Test susceptibility of both wild and GEM to create a list of insecticides that ca be ued oin
	  the even of an unwanted outcome of a GEM release even premature escape.

- Potential for ecosystem interactions - local competitor and predator species, pollinators, and
  other valued species

### Safety parameters--what to measure

- Vector competence:  CSIRO is developing a risk assessment for this issue.

- Direct effects: toxicity and allergenicity--of new proteins in salivary glands.

- Spread to other organisms:  
	
	- species in the complex
	
	- horizontal gene transfer

- Adverse effects on other species
	
	- what is the comparator? pesticide? 
	
	- species to test?
	
	- ecological studies are not trivial
	
	- impact on pollinators
	
- Insecticide susceptibility

- Genetic and/or phenotypic stability

- Behavioral and other effects impacting safety
	
	- swarming?
		
	- olfaction?
	
	- expanding geographic range?
	
	- others?

### Design of safety studies

##### Nonsilly questions

Allergenicity/toxicity

- novel proteins present in saliva? if not, then no need to go further

- protein profile in saliva? should it be done?

- database studies for allergenicity/toxicity for expressed proteins.

- acute toxicity test

- whole mosquito feeding:  the test is not strictly a toxicity test, but is seen in some countries
  as an indicator of toxicity.

Vector competence: Will mosquito become a better vector for the same pathogen, or become a vector
for a new pathogen?

- do infection assays for a set of example pathogens.

- discussion on whether to test pathogens of community concern. Criteria for picking pathogen.
  Credible explanations for why you pick certain pathogens to test are needed.
	
	- Does the pathogen (virus) occur in mosquitoes?
	
	- Not been known to be found in Anopheles, but we tested a couple to see.
	
	- chikungunya,dengue, zika, yellow fever, o'nyon yong, rift valley fever
	
	- filariasis(?)-could be modeled. Could test specifc characteristics that are relevant to
	  increased ability to transmit.

Insecticide resistance/susceptibility

- protocol established (WHO)

- strain should be no more resistant than the population where it will be introduced

##### Silly questions

Feeding behavior change: what if transgene jumps into a anthropophilic species from a zoophilic
species (arabiensis for example)?

- measure probing and biting rate in the lab

What are the harms of controlling only temporarily--causing rebound? 

- this is a problem for other control methods as well

##### Other points discussed

Genotypes in which to do the tests:  how many local strains should be done? This is not a trivial
undertaking.  Is G3 so different from local populations that we need to test in all these
backgrounds?  Possible approach:  get approval in one strain (e.g. G3, and do adaptation work
later).

Engagement with regulators and community necessary to determine relevant questions that might not be
scientifically obvious.

We should not underestimate the importance of these projects, and therefore not minimize the
importance of the supporting work to successfully deploy it.
