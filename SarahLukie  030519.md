# Insurance

Is there a possibility for an insurance product?

Industry worked with a reinsurance company [Swiss Re?]—no product available because no ability to valuate damage and no baseline in countries of interest.

This was the motivation for the compact.  Did not want to go with some kind of liability fund (proposed by some countries), because the concluded such an arrangement would be useless. 

They (Bio?) have talked to Gates about them doing it themselves.
Gates Foundation and other donors:  they didn’t care.

The problem is because there is the possibility of catastrophic damage:  analog is hazardous goods, oil spills, which was not a direction people wanted to go.

**Secretariat’s page on liability and redress. Publicly available.**

**IUCN publications—environmental damage and financial security options**

**Worked with Kenya (BIO). Financial cap on liability.  Some openness on the part of Swiss Re to insure if there’s a cap.**

2006, 2007, 2008—A lot of work was done on this at CBD. 

Looking into financial security under N-KL was a necessary concession to move the N-KL forward, but this effort is is going to look at things they have done before.  Probably just need to update it.

There is currently no money for the study.  Need to do it by the beginning of next year, but unlikely that they will do it this year.
