== Introduction, Tony James
=== Benefits of population modification
* Sustainability
* No empty ecological niche
* Stable in low population densities
* Allows serial approach in resource-constrained control

=== Goals
* Adapt coupled Cas9-effector genes
* Identify a field site in Africa for testing

=== Progress
* developing a field ready product
* collecting baseline data
* engaging with African collaborators

== Design of a gene drive system, Rebeca Carballar
=== Prototype: Gantz et al. (2015)
* Fitness cost
* Resistant alleles

=== New drive system to solve the problems above
* Fitness cost problem: Cardinal gene (another gene in the ommochrome pathway)
* Resistant allele problem: use nanos promoter
* Also evaluated off-target effects: up to 6 generations, have not found any off-target effects
* Variation in target site: field polymorphisms exist; all identified polymorphisms are capable of being cut by Cas9, but some with lower efficiency.
Frequency of these variants in the field are low.

=== Linking drive to effector
Studying potential targets for antibodies

===  TPP
* Source DNA: all orthologous from target species
* No breakdown due to mutation or recombination
* Small size as possible
* Fewest components
* No off-target effects
* No resistant target
* No non-target drive effects
* Drive inheritance in both sexes
* 100% full introduction into target wild populations
* Spread only into target mosquito species
* < 1 year to full introduction
* Male competitiveness equal or more than wt
* Female fecundity --?
* Others...

=== Discussion
[quanda]
Mark Benedict: Do you plan to take cardinal gene to the field?::
The gene would be a good tool to use in the field.
Tony: the cardinal gene doesn't seem to be a problem for the field.

*Ethan Bier considers the drive system to be an ideal drive; meets the TPP*

== Ethan Bier: Gene Drive and Effector Genes Future Plans
=== First generation drives

Isaacs et al. 2012: If coupled with a mechanism for gene spread...malaria resistance genes could be used as a malaria control tool.

=== New effectors
* Nanobodies against Pfs25: V~H~ portion of heavy chain
* Anti-Pfs25 single chain
* Anti-Pvs25 monoclonal antibodies
* etc.

=== Promoters being used
* Peritrophic Matrix 1
* Carboxypeptidase
* Vitellogenin (inducible)

=== Transgenesis
* Single effectors
* Multi-effectors

=== Conducting parasite challenge assays
They have the assays working well.

=== Second generation drives
* Swap constructs to recode existing drives: increased efficiency of original drive cassette.
* Allelic drive: host parasite refractory allele of FREP1
* Essential gene targets: Prosalpha2, Rab5, Rab11.
Initial testing in split drives, can convert to full drives.

=== Drives in other organisms
* Mouse tyrosinase locus: if copying happens, progeny mice are white, carry RFP and the _chinchilla_ marker
* Bacteria (Valderrama et al. 2019)

=== Drive neutralization systems
* ERACRs: eliminate it
* e-CHACRs: keep it parked

=== Discussion
=== CRISPR-Cas9 target sites in natural populations of _An. gambiae_ and _Ae. egypti_
More than 90% of protein encoding genes have at least one Cas-9 target site.
Therefore, if you can tolerate a resistance frequency of < 1%, as in a population modification strategy, then you're OK.
However, in a population suppression strategy, the resistance frequency tolerance will be much less because resistance is under strong selection.

=== Candidate field trial sites
==== Comoros
* genetically isolated from mainland
* genetically simpler than mainland

==== São Tomé and Príncipe
* little dispersal off islands
* less polymorphic than mainland
* by contrast, Bioko island is more like mainland
* geographic distance from mainland generally more genetically isolated from mainland
* were in São Tomé and Príncipe in November 2019, returning in March 2020
* collected samples for genome sequencing (under permit)
* species composition: _An. coluzzii_, _An. gambiae_ (small populations), hybrids, and introgressed individuals
* Questions
** Are populations on each island structured into discrete sub-populations?
** Is _An. gambiae_ ss. present in São Tomé and Príncipe?
** Nature of individuals from which the ITS2 diagnostic fails, but DIS is + for _An. coluzzii_?
** What is the origin of the _kdr_ (associated with insecticide resistance) mutation in São Tomé and Príncipe
* Future plans (March-April 2020)
** first MRR study
** second attempt to establish lab colony
** survey mosquitoes at interior sites
** extensive community engagement activities
* under Open Philanthropy funding, will establish a relationship with São Tomé and Príncipe and UC Irvine

=== Discussion
[quanda]
Do any roads connect the East and West directly in Príncipe?::
Not good roads--could be evident in the genetic structure.
What is the prevalence on malaria?::
Not high now, but increasing.
A malaria program is in place, but mosquitoes were abundant.
Malaria control program is primarily drug-based, which would be synergistic with the population modification strategy.
Were adults collected infected?::
Will be testing for that.
Sustainability::
External funding-dependent projects suffer from lack of continuity because funding stops.
This strategy can maintain control without constant funding.

== Malaria in São Tomé and Príncipe (STP), João Pinto
=== History
* early records of intermittent fevers in 1520
* sugarcane expansion and slave trade 1600 leads to increased malaria
* coffee/cocoa expansion leads to more immigration and increased malaria
* 1980-82 malaria eradication, reduced malaria to 0.6%
* subsequent increase due to lack of maintenance
* 2005-2010 malaria elimination program: LLIN, IPT, ACT, IRS

=== 1997-2004 research
* mosquito abundance (malaria?) decreases with altitude
* biting behavior: early biting (São Tomé); exophagic; exophilic.
It is possible that dogs are a more prominent host than humans (due to their outdoor preference).
* Insecticide resistance: susceptible to malathion, deltamethrin, permethrin, DDT.
Perhaps some resistance to permethrin
* no _kdr_ mutation (although present now)
* population genetics: lower genetic diversity in island populations, except Bioko island (corroborates Greg Lanzaro's results)
* current work focusing on
** assessing suitability for transgenic releases
** pre-and post intervention comparisons
** _

=== Training
* short courses
* Masters in Medical Parasitology (2 year program)
* PhD Biomedical Sciences/International Health (4 year program)

=== Discussion
[quanda]
How collect resting mosquitoes?::
Aspirators
How do the migration numbers fit with the genetic data?::
_
Origin of _kdr_?::
Greg: It evolved independently on Bioko. But Pinto thinks it is probably an introduction on other islands.

They are now in the process of relationship-building, then will rely on local expertise to advise on how best to conduct communication efforts and training.
Regulatory engagement::
They have engaged with NEPAD and the Kenyan NBA, but not with the Cartagena Focal Point.
