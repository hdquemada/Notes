# Common Points

## Human Health

* Fault trees were difficult to use for risk assessment
* Needed to connect with harms to be useful for a risk assessor
* Increased vectorial competence was plausible, and the approaches used to address this concern could be used to deal with other known pathogens that were transmitted
* Novel blood-borne pathogens:  lack of plausibility gave some groups difficulty
* Events happening in the salivary gland and proboscis could be key to addressing these two concerns.
* Spatial and temporal heterogeneity as they affect the spread of the drive will be and important consideration.
* *Risk for these endpoints depended upon the lack of suppression (because they would not be concerns if populations were suppressed)*
## Animal Health
* Same as animal health
* Need to check if pathogens transmitted by An. g. are different to determine if they trigger any different considerations from Human Health
* Indirect competition scenario

## Biodiversity
* HGT: Likelihood of large, functional construct
* Literature reviews, bioinformatics instead of experimentation to address HGT questions.
* Empty niche and mosquito role in pollination leading to environmental harms if mosquito populations were reduced.
* Lack of harm

## Water Quality
* Harms?
* Size and permanence of water
*  Toxicity is already being tested for other reasons, and can be used to address this concern
	* database query
	* fish feeding
