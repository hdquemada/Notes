2019-08-08 Day 2 of workshop.

Dave O'Brochta: Synthetic gene drives--homing drives; special case of copy/paste
	-Natural gene drive system Homing Endonuclease Gene in yeast.
	-Synthetic gene drive uses CRISPR-Cas9
	-The CRISPR-Cas9 system mimics natural HEG
	-Effector genes can be added to the gene drive system that can move with the drive.

	-Early experiment:  gene drive failed due to evolution of resistance (Hammond et al., 2017)
	-Later experiment with a construct that prevented evolution of resistance showed gene drive to 100% (Kyrou et al.,
	2018)

Brinda Dass: Risk Assessment--Hazard Identification
	-Hazard is the agent of concern
	-Harm is the adverse effect caused by the hazard
	-Exposure is ...
	-Risk is the likelihood of harm
	-Risk analysis
		>Risk assessment
		>Risk management
		>Risk communication
	-Risk Assessment Process
		-Establish context and scope
		-Identify & characterize hazards
			>What hazards in the GMO are attributable to the modification?
			>Comparative hazards
			>Case by case basis related to
				*Genotype
				*Phenotype
				*Receiving Environment
				*Intended Use
				*Any/all relevant history of use of same/similar GMO
			>Causal Pathways: How can adverse outcomes/events happen from the hazard.
		-Assess exposure
		-Characterize risk
		
Karen Hokanson:  Likelihood and exposure assessment

Karen Hokanson:  Hazard/consequence assessment and Risk Characterization
	-Uncertainty: Cartagena Protocol Annex III deals with it by requesting more information and imposing risk
	management and/or monitoring

Ivan Rwomushana: Risk assessment for biocontrol organisms
	-ISPM3 are guidelines for handling biological control agents, including risk assessment	

Scott Shore:  Case Study 1
	-What laws and what ministries would provide the legal framework for conventional SIT program?
		>Mozambique:  Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Energy (because of radiation)
		>Uganda: Ministry of Health, Ministry of Science and Technology, National Biosafety Committee(?)
		>South Africa: Ministry of Agriculture
		>Madagascar: Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Science, Ministry of Health
		>Angola: Ministry of Environment
	-The laws identifying these ministries would determine the scope of the risk assessment.

Scott Shore:  Case Study 2
	-Transgenic SIT, non-gene drive
	-Laws in country:  at least the National Biosafety body	

2019-08-09 Day 3 of workshop

Emilie Pothin: Using models for malaria interventions and decision-making
	-Overview of models; what they can do and cannot do

Dave O'Brochta: How gene drive developers are using models
	-We use models for making decisions in real life every day
	-Showed examples of models to show how spread of drive depending upon different rates of evolution of resistance

Dave O'Brochta: Post workshop assessment 

Case Studies
	-Population suppression with gene drive.

Oral comments:
Zambia:
Thanks for efforts to build capacity for member states--responding to directives of member states
Would they recommend? Urge individual countries for in-country training

Comoros:
It would be better to have similar workshops in other African countries.

Angola:
Appreciated the opportunity to attend

Rufus (African Union Biosafety Forum)
Thanks to ABNE for building capacity of Africans
